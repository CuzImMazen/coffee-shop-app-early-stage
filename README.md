# Coffee Shop App (Early Project)

This is an **early-stage Flutter project** I built while learning Flutter and Supabase.  
It is a simple coffee shop app demonstrating:

- Flutter widgets and layouts
- Bloc/Cubit state management
- Supabase integration for authentication and products

> ⚠️ Note: This is an early project and does not reflect my current Flutter skill level.

> 💡 i used real-time data base for learning purposes to be comfortable with dart Streams.
